### Passion for Data. Driven to make a Difference.

After years of all-round stakeholder and customer-facing roles, it has become quite evident that my love, curiosity, and strengths are in working with databases, systems, and analyses.

Leveraging different software to house data and to provide at-the-finger-tip dashboards, it is my joy to work on all data related matters from start to end. To me, data's entire journey starts from data governance, system architecture and eventual creation of dashboards and reports for my decision-making stakeholders.

I'm constantly sharpening my skills outside the workplace, testing my skills on integration & data courses and sample projects, simply because it's a joy to connect technologies and see that data flow clean and true!
